# Django Portfolio Website

This project is a personal portfolio website built using Django. The UI design is sourced from [BootstrapMade.com](https://bootstrapmade.com/), while the backend and dynamic functionality are fully implemented by me. The admin panel allows for easy customization of the website.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Management:** The site has been transformed from static to dynamic using Django.
- **Admin Panel:** Customize the content of the website easily through the Django admin panel.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI is designed using Bootstrap, making it responsive and mobile-friendly.
